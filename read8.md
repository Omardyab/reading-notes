# ***Html***
We have 6 levels heading in Html 
here are some basic commands:

![html basic commands](ASAC/reading-notes/html.PNG)

# CSS and Functions :

div tag does same as section but main difference is that its not semantic tag (div i would not understand)  
container 


fucnctions 

what:
-Set of instructions 
-Code block that does something 
 
why:
Split your code into smaller tasks 
Reusable 

how: 
function declaration 
function nameoffunction (parameters or none)
{
function should be called to have this code running 
}
call it 
nameoffunction(arguments)

another way:
assign the funciton to a variable 
var x=function()
{
call the code to have it running :) 
}
x(); 
call it/invoke it 

# JavaScript:

## This is a summary about Javascript  

Def: Make your webpages more interactive, a script should be written based on your goals.
1-Access content: Selecting Items
2-Modify content: add text or remove it.
3-Program Rules: browser follow a set of steps to change the content of a page.
4-React to events: script run after an event.

In order to design your website within Javascript: 
1-Define your goal
2-Design your script 
3-Code each step 

### ***Two ways to use Javascript:***
- *Opening and closing statements, the best is at the end of the body*
- *Externally (recommended).*

### ***Naming your variables has rules:***

- Must begin with a letter, dollar sign ($), or an underscore (_).
- Name can contain letters, numbers, dollar signs ($), or an underscore (_).

- Keywords or reserved words cant be used. 

- Variables are case-sensitive.
- Use a name that describes the kind of information that the variable stores.

- capital letter for the first letter of every word if the variable more than one word.

 Colors ['white'] is an example of an array 

### ***here some other examples*** 

    // one line comment

    //its for showing a message 

    /*

### ***Datatypes:*** 

-String: any text or set of characters " " or ' ' 

Numbers: any number in js (2, 4.6, 0.9) 

Boolean: True or false 
Variables: store values into it
Camel case:
var firstName = "Omar "
Operators: a symbol that does an action 
; is not obligatory in js, it's later on it required 

    */ 

    //assignment operator  =

    //arthmatic operators + - * / **(power) %  etc 

### ***Console***
- Def: is important for developers to get to know what is happening 
- Something we can use 
- show the errors if we have "useful when there is a 1000 lines of code " 
Example var firstName = 'Omar';
    console.log(x*z)
    console.log(firstName)

### ***Concatination*** 

- `console.log(X + firstName);`
- `var fullName = firstName + X`
- `console.log(fullName)`

### ***Comparison operartors*** 
- greater than > 
- less than
- greater than or equal >=
- less than or equal >= 
- not equal !=
- == compare two values 
- === strictly equal , check everything datatype and value

loops 
Def: set of instructions to repeat a bock until a specific condtion is met 
Why: we need loops to reduce redunedent code 

Examples: 
While(Condition){}
For(var i=1;i=>20; i++){console.log(i);}


# Commit 
Commit is used to track and save our modifications
