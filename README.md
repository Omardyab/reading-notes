#### _Growth Mindset_

_A growth mindset_ unlike a fixed mindset is the ability to develop yourself which can be done through perseverance and effort, it's simply the love of learning. 

In order to keep yourself in a growth mindset its important to remember the following:

* Never compare yourself to anyone else, everyone is different in their own ways. 

* Always think positively and be open-minded.

* Learn from your mistakes and never give up.
