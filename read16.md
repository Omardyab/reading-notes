# READING 10:
Chapter 10 of Javascript is dealing with error handling and debugging.
A console is a built-in tool that can help to look for errors.
It's important to know how a script is processed, and in which order, one line at a time.
mainly three execution contexts for each statement: 
-Global context.
-function context.
-Eval context(hidden function called eval())

There are seven types of errors in javascript( Type error is one example)
Document instead of the document is a clear example of type error.


Mainly 2 things to solve an error:
1-Debug the script.
2-Handle errors using try, catch, and finally statements.

In conclusion: errors are mostly due to case sensitivity, missing a semicolon, and could be a data type issue.
