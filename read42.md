* Testing Risks: "You should be well acquainted with the platform you are working on, along with the software testing tools being used"

* Premature Release Risk: "a fair amount of knowledge to analyze the risk associated with releasing unsatisfactory or untested software is required"

* Software Risks: "You should be well versed with the risks associated with the software development process."

Risk Assessment: has three perspectives: 

1- Effect

2- Cause

3-Likelihood

Three main steps to perform Risk Analysis as per the author?
* Searching the risk
