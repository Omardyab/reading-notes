The article mentioned the Pain vs Suffering relationship.
Pain is good when we grow afterward, there is a purporse at the end, in other words, the Pain of Growth, unlike Suffering.


## A beginner's guide to Big O Notation
This notation describes how complex is an algorithm (or the performance).
The article gave some examples to clear it out, sometimes it depends on the size of the input data set, and some others times it does not (O(N), O(1)), while O(N^2) when nested iterations are involved.
O(2^N) on the other hand is an algorithm that doubles within addition to the input dataset.
O(log N) is a binary search mechanism to search sorted datasets.
