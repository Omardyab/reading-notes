# Reading 14: matplotlib 

## Nicolas P. Rougier the author of this tutorial introduces this 2D-graphics tool to visualize data.

        Ipyhton=> interactive shell => this command (--pylab) allows interactive matplotlib sessions. 
        pyplot=> interface to matplotlib library

        Rougier then gave some examples for sin and cos functions plot (even changing colors setting a limit, setting ticks and a lot more)

        Figures => figure is the windows in the GUI that has "Figure #" as title

        Subplots=> plots in a regular grid ( number of rows and columns)

        Axes=> placement of plots at any location

        placement of plots at any location=> several locators for different kind of requirements.

        Animation => tools for creating animation very intuitively, with the possibility to save them in all kind of formats.

        Drip drop=> simple rain effect .

        Earthquakes=> use the rain animation to visualize earthquakes on the planet

        Other Types of Plots=> Regular Plots, Scatter Plots, Bar Plots, Contour Plots and Pie Charts and a lot more even 3D Plots.
