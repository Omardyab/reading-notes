## Reading 6:
### The article: Understanding The Problem Domain Is The Hardest Part Of Programming
In this reading, the author talked about the problem domain.
Simple functions and applications are important to get familiar and understand better, it can be a reference sometimes,this makes learning and understanding easier.
Problem domain can be hard especially that as programmers given info are not enough but there are ways to get over it, breaking it down into small pieces can be a solution.
Agile or waterfall can make the problem domain easy to spot.


### Chapter 3: Objects.
Objects are a set of variables and functions.
Variables are properties.
Functions are methods.
Literal notation is an easy way to create an object.
Two ways to access an object whether methods or properties:
1-dot notation. .
2-Square brackets [ ].

How about creating objects:
Example:use new, var car= new Object();
it's possible to update the value of properties using dot notation or square brackets.
it's possible to delete a property using the delete keyword.
Constructors are templates that work with the object's properties and methods.

### Chapter 5 :DOM.
Dom is Document Object Model. 
it's about creating a model and how browsers deal with it, and how javascript can access it.
API's let programs and scripts talk to each other.
The chapter talked about the DOM tree model, how to locate the node, use its text content and other elements
Dom queries are elements in the DOM, it could return one element or a Nodelist.
storing elements means storing the locations of those elements.
selecting elements can be by using ID attributes, class attributes, tag name, and CSS selectors.
two ways to select an element from Nodelist:
1-Item() method.
2-Array syntax(faster).

Traversing the DOM: selecting an element depending on another one.

Adding or removing HTML content in two ways:
1-innerHTML, better in updating entire fragments.
2-Dom manipulation: targeting nodes in the DOM tree, can be used to remove elements from the DOM tree.
We should be aware of attackers(XSS) when using innerHTML.
