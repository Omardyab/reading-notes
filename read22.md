What is component?
A component is a software object that interacts with other components, containing defined-functionality. It has a defined interface, and it's functionality conforms to the common behavior of all components within the architecture. Component also have the ability of being modular, portable, replaceable, and resuable.
What are the characteristics of a component?
Resuability: If not designed for a specific task, componenets are made to be reused in many situations and different applications
Replaceable: Components can be freely substituted for others
Not context Specific: Design to work in different contexts and environments
Extensible: Components can be extended from other components to introduce new behaviors
Encapsulated: Obfuscates interl processes, while depicting the interface and allowing the caller to use it functionality
Independent: Designed to minimally rely on other components
What are the advantages of using component based architecture?
Ease of deployment: Deploying new versions without impacting other components
Reduced cost: Allows splitting the cost of maintenance and development by using 3rd part components
Ease of development: Components can be well defined, allowing development with out impacting other parts of the system
Resuable: Cost can be spread across several applications systems by reusing the components
Modifications of Technical Complexity: Component container and it's services allow modifying it's complexity
Reliability: As new components are created they enhance the realiability of the entire system via reuse
System maintenance and Evolution: Implementations can be change and updated without affecting the rest of the system
Independent: Allows component development by different groups in parallel
