# Configuring Django Settings: Best Practices

## Managing Django Settings: Issues
Different environments. Usually, you have several environments: local, dev, ci, qa, staging, production, etc. 

Sensitive data. You have SECRET_KEY in each Django project. 

Sharing settings between team members. a general approach to eliminate human error when working with the settings. 

Django settings are a Python code. It gives you a lot of flexibility, but can also be a problem – instead of key-value pairs, `settings.py` can have a very tricky logic.

## Setting Configuration: Different Approaches

settings_local.py
used when configuring a Django project on a production server for the first time. I saw a lot of people use it back in the day, and I still see it now.

The basic idea of this method is to extend all environment-specific settings in the settings_local.py file, which is ignored by VCS. Here’s an example:

`settings.py` file:
```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com']
DEBUG = False
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'production_db',
        'USER': 'user',
        'PASSWORD': 'password',
        'HOST': 'db.example.com',
        'PORT': '5432',
        'OPTIONS': {
            'sslmode': 'require'
        }
    }
}

...
a
from .settings_local import *
```

settings_local.py file:

```
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost']
DEBUG = True
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'local_db',
        'HOST': '127.0.0.1',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}
```
**Pros:**
- Secrets not in VCS

**Cons:**
- settings_local.py is not in VCS, so you can lose some of your Django environment settings.
- The Django settings file is a Python code, so settings_local.py can have some non-obvious logic.
- You need to have settings_local.example (in VCS) to share the default configurations for developers.


# SSH

## What is SSH
SSH, or Secure Shell, is a remote administration protocol that allows users to control and modify their remote servers over the Internet. The service was created as a secure replacement for the unencrypted Telnet and uses cryptographic techniques to ensure that all communication to and from the remote server happens in an encrypted manner. It provides a mechanism for authenticating a remote user, transferring inputs from the client to the host, and relaying the output back to the client.

* The Figure Below shows a typical SSH Window.

## Understanding Different Encryption Techniques

The significant advantage offered by SSH over its predecessors is the use of encryption to ensure secure transfer of information between the host and the client. Host refers to the remote server you are trying to access, while the client is the computer you are using to access the host. There are three different encryption technologies used by SSH:

1. Symmetrical encryption
1. Asymmetrical encryption
1. Hashing.

### Symmetric Encryption

Symmetric encryption is a form of encryption where a secret key is used for both encryption and decryption of a message by both the client and the host. Effectively, any one possessing the key can decrypt the message being transferred.

### Asymmetric Encryption

Unlike symmetrical encryption, asymmetrical encryption uses two separate keys for encryption and decryption. These two keys are known as the public key and the private key. Together, both these keys form a public-private key pair.

### Hashing

One-way hashing is another form of cryptography used in Secure Shell Connections. One-way-hash functions differ from the above two forms of encryption in the sense that they are never meant to be decrypted. They generate a unique value of a fixed length for each input that shows no clear trend which can exploited. This makes them practically impossible to reverse.
