Events: there are different types of events.
events are triggered when the user interacts with the Html on a web page:
-Select the element 
-indicate the event
-state the code which runs when the code executed.
element.onevent=functionName;

The flow of the event is as follows:
-Event stats at the node outwards(bubbling).
-Event starts at the least node inwards(capturing).
a lot of event listeners can slow down your page.
preventing default behavior can help in avoiding issues.

-unload
-error
-Scroll etc

Mouse events are fired when the mouse is moved and buttons clicked(click,dbclick,mouse down)
