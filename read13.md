## Reading 7 Domain Modeling: 


Def: Conceptual model the process if creatin it is Domain Model.
The reading was a practical example of how to implement a constructor function and define it as a function expression.
How objects(using new) and instances are created.
The prototype is an object stunt double, less memory is being consumed when using it.
The reading provided some tips when building a domain model.

Arrays are object: set of key/value pair, browsers come with built it objects,(document is an example).
Global objects used to easily code. such as length.
each character in a string is having a number (index).
Math object is just another example, Math.round() rounds the number to the nearest integer.

functions groups set of statements and can take parameters.
In an object, variables are properties and functions are methods.
Array and objects can contain the other, both used to have complex data.
