# Reading 12 : 
SQL vs NoSQL Database  
SQL :   Relational Databases (RDBMS);
        table based databases
        predefined schema
        vertically scalable 
        SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data
        SQL databases are scaled by increasing the horse-power of the hardware
examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL. NoSQL

NoSQL:  non-relational or distributed database.
        Document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores
        the collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to
        dynamic schema for unstructured data.
        horizontally scalable
        databases are scaled by increasing the databases servers in the pool of resources to reduce the load.
        queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database.
NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb

Q&A: 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are vertically scalable

Give a real world example.
already mentioned above. 

What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data
